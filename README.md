The purpose of this assignment was to build an interactive dashboard to explore a given dataset.

First, utilize the D3 library to read in information from a provided url.
Second, create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
Third, create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
Then, display the sample metadata as well as each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.
Lastly, update all the plots when a new sample is selected.

In my Github repository, there is a bonus.js file. It is empty as that part of the assignment was optional.

I did use Ask BCS for this assignment in this beginning as I struggled to get started.
